         price of onion in the wholesale market is going down swiftly after the news of allowing import from 
        India was published. According to Prothom Alo reports, the price of local onions has dropped by
         Tk 20 per kg in Shyambazar and Karwan Bazar in Dhaka and Khatunganj in Chattogram.As the price of onion increased exorbitantly, it was decided to allow import to protect the interests of consumers along with reducing the hardship of fixed income people,
         said a notification of the Ministry of Agriculture on Saturday.

        Considering the interests of the farmers, 
         the ministry stopped allowing the import of onions from
        15 March.There has been a tussle between the ministries of agriculture and commerce
                 over permission to import onions for quite some time. The commerce secretary had sent a letter to the agriculture secretary on 14 May to seek approval to import onion at a limited level. At that time, the price of onion was Tk 70 to Tk 80 per kg, double than the price a month ago. According to Trading Corporation
                of Bangladesh (TCB) data, onions were bought and sold at Tk 90-100 per kg in Dhaka on Sunday.
